# Slack Grade Sender


This is a simple project built for Dr. Anthony Clark at Missouri State University which sends students their grades over Slack. 

The project takes an input CSV file as above and maps the email email addresses on file to a student registered on the class Slack to send them their grades. 

## Usage

```
./main.py <grades.csv> <SLACK_API_TOKEN>
```
